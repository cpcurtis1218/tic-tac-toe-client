# Tic-Tac-Snow


## Technologies Used
In creating this application I used a combination of html, scss, javascript, bootstrap, jQuery, and ajax.


## Planning and Execution
When first planning my game I created two wireframes (see below) and about a dozen user stories.  Once I had a solid Idea for what I wanted the game to look like, I created the game board itself in html.  I looked at the API documentation when setting up my gameboard so that I could be sure that it would work later on.  Once I had a good html outline I wrote the game-logic that makes the game playable.  Again, I looked at the API documentation so that once I was ready to send each move to the API it would be a smooth transition.  Once the game logic was completed I worked on all of the API authenticaion.  Once the authentication was completed I focused on the game API interaction.  Once this was completed, I styled the site and added the finishing touches.


## Future Additions
In the future I would like to add a scoreboard which would track the longest win streak.
